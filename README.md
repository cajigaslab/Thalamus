# Thalamus

Thalamus is an open-source Python program for real-time, synchronized, closed-loop multimodal data capture. One of Thalamus's key strengths is meeting the constraints of an operating room, facilitating clinical applications of brain computer interface technology involving behavioral and electrophysiological data streams.

Like all open-source projects, Thalamus will benefit from your involvement, suggestions and contributions. This platform is intended as a repository for extensions to the program based on your code contributions as well as for flagging and tracking open issues.

The code respository for Thalamus is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/cajigaslab/thalamus. You can download the example data file for the simple use case from the paper on the same GitHub. Critical revisions will be provided as software updates as appropriate.

If you use Thalamus in your work, please remember to cite the GitHub in any publications. Thalamus is protected by the GPL v2 Open Source License.
