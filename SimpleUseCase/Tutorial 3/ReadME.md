# Overview
Follow this tutorial to generate **Figure 5** using data output from Thalamus. **Figure 5** includes a plot of voltage over time to visualize the Local Field Potential (LFP), a beta power heat map, hand velocity over time, and power spectral density during motion and at rest. 

# Setup
Download the **Thalamus_Figure5.mlx** file and the .m files in the **Function** folder. Open them in MATLAB and run as directed. See **Thalamus_Figure5.pdf** for a print-out of how this should run and the associated output. 

# Data
The data will be made accessible on Kaggle and the link added here for ease of access.

# Analysis
You should be able to replicate the result below:
